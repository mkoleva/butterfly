CONTENTS:

The package contains two exercises:

exercise1.m -- learns and test an image classifier on benchmark data
exercise2.m -- learns your own classifier

The computer vision algorithms are implemented by VLFeat
(http://www.vlfeat.org). This package contains the following MATLAB
functions:

standardizeImage.m
        Rescale an image to a standard size.

computeFeatures.m
        Compute dense SIFT keypoints and descriptors.

quantizeDescriptors.m
        Qquantize visual descriptors into visual words.

computeHistogram.m
        Compute a spatial histogram of visual words (starting from the
        features).

removeSpatialInformation
        Reduce a spatial histogram to a simple one.

computeHistogramFromImage.m
        Compute a histogram of visual words (starting from an image).

computeHistogramsFromImageList.m
        Applies computeHistogramFromImage to a list of images.

trainLinearSVM.m
        Learn a linear support vector machine.

displayRankedImagelist.m
        Visualize a subset of a ranked list of images.

getImageSet.m
        Scan a directory for images.


APPENDX (INSTALLATION):

Run MATLAB and execute the command PREPROCESS() in extra/. This will
download the VLFeat library (http://www.vlfeat.org), then, it will
compute a visual vocabulary and spatial histograms of visual words for
the images.
